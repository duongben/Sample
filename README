This is a Sample project to showcase some basic enterprise Java web application competency.

The web presentation layer will follow a standard MVC architecture of:
 - JSP templates as the view (containing HTML structure, CSS decorations, and Javascipt behavior).
 - RESTful Spring Controllers.
 - Plain old Java objects (POJO) models.

A services layer will seperate the above layer from the below data persistance layer.

The persistance layer with encapsulate all data mapping logic.
